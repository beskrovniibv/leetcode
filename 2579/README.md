## 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells

There exists an infinitely large two-dimensional grid of uncolored unit cells. You are given a positive integer `n`, indicating that you must do the following routine for `n` minutes:

- At the first minute, color **any** arbitrary unit cell blue.

- Every minute thereafter, color blue **every** uncolored cell that touches a blue cell.

Return _the number of **colored cells** at the end of `n` minutes_.

**Example 1:**
>
>**Input**: n = 1
>
>**Output**: 1
>
>**Explanation**: After 1 minute, there is only 1 blue cell, so we return 1.

**Example 2:**
>
>**Input**: n = 2
>
>**Output**: 5
>
>**Explanation**: After 2 minutes, there are 4 colored cells on the boundary and 1 in the center, so we return 5.

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= n <= 10<sup>5</sup></code>
